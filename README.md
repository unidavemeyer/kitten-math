# kitten-math
Education/game to rescue kittens by solving math problems. Initial ideas:

 * kitten in a cage; as timer expires, locks appear; as problems solve, locks disappear
 * timer counts down from 10 (or whatever) seconds; once problem is answered, remaining seconds worth of kittens escape

Future looking but not to implement right now:

 * Would be fun to look into 500/1000 rescue goals, maybe
 * Would be super valuable to weight trickier problems to have higher likelihood
 * Would be fun to add an actual little graphic of some kind showing kittens disappearing or something
