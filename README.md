# kitten-math
Education/game to rescue kittens by solving math problems. Initial ideas:

 * kitten in a cage; as timer expires, locks appear; as problems solve, locks disappear
 * timer counts down from 10 (or whatever) seconds; once problem is answered, remaining seconds worth of kittens escape

With the basic game in place, my next plans:

 * I need to make the fonts all a bit bigger (they're too small for kids, Val thinks)
 * I need to space stuff out a little bit more on the UI so it's not all bunched together
 * I need to add logging per problem so that I can later figure out goals and problem selection weighting

Future looking but not to implement right now:

 * Would be fun to look into 500/1000 rescue goals, maybe
 * Would be super valuable to weight trickier problems to have higher likelihood
